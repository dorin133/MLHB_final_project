# MLHB final project
## Chosen project topic: Accuracy as a self-fulfilling prophecy:

Predictive systems often display improved performance over time. In most cases, this
is attributed to the investment of intentional effort aimed at obtaining improvement -
collecting more data, retraining, modifying the algorithm, running A/B tests, etc. But in
practice, it is very hard (or impossible) to determine what truly causes improvement.
The goal of this project is to explore an alternative explanation for improved
performance in recommendation systems, which is that accuracy improves over time
because prediction becomes easier. The conjecture is that, as models are learned
and deployed over time, recommendations cause the input data to shift towards
distributions that are concentrated on easy-to-predict items (think why this should
hold!). If true, learning over time would result in a "delusion" of improved predictive
performance. The aims of this project are to establish and explore this conjecture,
and to find conditions under which it holds - or does not.

## Project guideline:

The outcome of the project should be a notebook that explores your research
question and related hypotheses. The notebook should tell a story:

○ Start with giving relevant background.

○ State your hypotheses/conjectures, and how you plan to test them

○ Describe the setup and environment in which you chose to experiment

○ Present your approach

○ Run experiments

○ Report your results - use lots of plots!

○ Explain your results, relate them to your hypotheses

○ End with a discussion, including merits and limitations of your approach and results

○ If possible, draw practical conclusions

## Final note
The goal of the project is for you to demonstrate clear understanding, deep
thinking, and an open mind to research.
